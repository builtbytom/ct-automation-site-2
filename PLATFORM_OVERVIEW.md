# CT Business Automations Platform - Master Reference

## 🎯 What We're Building
A white-label automation platform that looks custom-built for each client while running on shared N8N infrastructure. Clients get a premium experience, you get recurring revenue.

## 📁 Essential Documentation
1. **CLIENT_AUTOMATION_SOP.md** - Step-by-step client onboarding
2. **SECURITY_CHECKLIST.md** - Security implementation (THIS IS GOLD)
3. **N8N_WORKFLOW_TEMPLATES.md** - Ready-to-use workflow templates

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

```
Client sees:        [Beautiful Portal] → "Their custom automation platform"
                           ↓
Reality:        [Secure API Layer] → Authentication, rate limiting, encryption
                           ↓
                    [N8N Backend] → Shared but isolated workflows
                           ↓
                 [PostgreSQL DB] → Encrypted configs, metrics, audit logs
```

## 💰 Business Model
- **Discovery Call**: $500 (credited toward setup)
- **Setup**: $1,500-4,000 (based on complexity)
- **Monthly**: $400 (includes all platform costs)
- **Extra**: $500 offboarding/migration package

## 🔐 Security Non-Negotiables
1. **Webhook Security**: Random URLs + header auth + signature verification
2. **Data Encryption**: AES-256 for credentials, bcrypt for passwords
3. **Audit Everything**: Every change logged with user, timestamp, IP
4. **Billing Kill Switch**: Non-payment = automations stop
5. **Zero Trust**: Verify everything, trust nothing

## 🚀 Quick Start for New Client

```bash
# 1. Run discovery call checklist
# 2. Create client in database
# 3. Generate security credentials
# 4. Deploy portal instance
# 5. Build N8N workflows from templates
# 6. Test everything
# 7. Client sign-off
# 8. Schedule Week 2 check-in
```
