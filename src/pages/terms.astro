      <h2>Let's Keep This Simple</h2>
      <p>
        I'm Tom from Connecticut Business Automation. These are the terms for working together. 
        No confusing legal jargon - just clear expectations for both of us.
      </p>

      <h2>What I Do</h2>
      <p>
        I create custom automation solutions for Connecticut businesses. This includes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Analyzing your current workflows</li>
        <li>Building automations that save you time</li>
        <li>Training you on how to use them</li>
        <li>Providing ongoing support (if you want it)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How We Work Together</h2>
      
      <h3>1. Discovery Call ($500)</h3>
      <p>
        We start with a paid discovery call where I dig into your business processes. You get a complete 
        automation roadmap whether we continue working together or not. If you hire me for implementation, 
        this $500 is credited to your project.
      </p>

      <h3>2. Implementation</h3>
      <p>
        After discovery, I'll give you a fixed price for building your automations. No hourly billing, 
        no surprise costs. The price we agree on is the price you pay.
      </p>

      <h3>3. Ongoing Support (Optional)</h3>
      <p>
        Monthly maintenance is available but never required. Month-to-month, cancel anytime with 30 days notice.
      </p>

      <h2>Payment Terms</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Discovery calls: Paid upfront</li>
        <li>Implementation: 50% to start, 50% when your system goes live</li>
        <li>Monthly support: Billed at the beginning of each month</li>
        <li>Accepted payment: Check, ACH, credit card (3% fee for cards)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What You Can Expect</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Honest communication:</strong> I'll tell you what's possible and what isn't</li>
        <li><strong>Your data stays yours:</strong> I don't keep copies of your business data</li>
        <li><strong>No vendor lock-in:</strong> Your automations run on your accounts, not mine</li>
        <li><strong>Documentation:</strong> You get clear guides for everything I build</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What I Expect From You</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Access:</strong> Temporary access to the systems we're connecting</li>
        <li><strong>Communication:</strong> Timely responses during implementation</li>
        <li><strong>Feedback:</strong> Tell me if something isn't working right</li>
        <li><strong>Payment:</strong> On time, as agreed</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Guarantees</h2>
      <p>
        I guarantee my work will function as promised. If an automation breaks due to my error within 
        the first 30 days, I fix it free. After that, fixes are covered under monthly support or 
        billed hourly.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <strong>ROI Promise:</strong> If I can't show you at least 5:1 ROI within 6 months, I'll refund 
        the implementation cost. (Hasn't happened yet.)
      </p>

      <h2>Limitations</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>I can't guarantee third-party services (like QuickBooks) won't change</li>
        <li>I'm not responsible for your data accuracy</li>
        <li>Automations require maintenance as your business evolves</li>
        <li>Results depend on you actually using what I build</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Intellectual Property</h2>
      <p>
        You own all automations I build for your business. I retain the right to use general concepts 
        and techniques for other clients (but never your specific data or business information).
      </p>

      <h2>Termination</h2>
      <p>
        Either of us can end our working relationship:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>During implementation: You pay for work completed</li>
        <li>Monthly support: 30 days notice to cancel</li>
        <li>Your automations keep working - they're yours</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Dispute Resolution</h2>
      <p>
        If we have a disagreement, we talk it out like adults. If that doesn't work, we use mediation 
        in Connecticut. Going to court is the last resort for both of us.
      </p>

      <h2>The Legal Stuff</h2>
      <p>
        This agreement is governed by Connecticut law. These terms constitute our entire agreement and 
        supersede any prior discussions. Any modifications must be in writing.
      </p>

          <strong>Bottom line:</strong> I run an honest business. You get what you pay for, I do good work, 
          and we both benefit. If that sounds fair, let's get started.
