# Competition Snapshot Tool - What We Built Today

## Overview
We created a free tool that shows Connecticut businesses how they stack up against local competitors on Google. It's branded under CT Business Automations and designed to generate leads through your "marketing by generosity" approach.

## What It Does
1. Business owner enters their name + location
2. Tool analyzes 5-10 local competitors
3. Shows comparison of:
   - Star ratings
   - Review counts
   - Response rates (huge opportunity here!)
   - Monthly review velocity
   - Missing keywords

## The Hook
The tool reveals painful truths like:
- "Your competitor responds to 98% of reviews, you're at 12%"
- "You're getting 2 reviews/month, competitors get 10+"
- Each insight naturally leads to automation solutions

## Current Status
✅ Fully functional with mock data
✅ Beautiful UI matching CT Automations branding
✅ Rate limiting and 24-hour caching built in
✅ "Free Tools" added to main navigation
✅ Zero cost to run (until you add Google API)

## Next Steps to Go Live
1. Follow instructions in GOOGLE_PLACES_API_SETUP.md
2. Add API key to Netlify environment variables
3. Update the function to use real Google data
4. Test with actual businesses

## Cost Protection Built In
- Hard limit: 1,000 requests/day ($5 max)
- IP-based rate limiting (10 searches per IP/day)
- 24-hour result caching
- Email gate after 3 searches (optional)

## Smart Features
