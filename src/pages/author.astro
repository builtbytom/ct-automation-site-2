            <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              I didn't start out as an "automation expert." I was just a business owner drowning in repetitive tasks, watching good money disappear into endless hours of manual work.
            </p>

            <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Over 20 years, I built and scaled businesses - including a $100M Amazon operation. When you're moving that volume, manual processes will bury you. So I learned to automate everything: inventory tracking, order routing, invoice collection, employee scheduling. Not because I loved technology, but because I loved having my evenings back.
            </p>

            <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              That big business eventually failed (story for another day), but the systems I built? They worked perfectly until the end. Now I help Connecticut small businesses build the same kind of systems - except you get them before you're drowning, not during.
            </p>

                "I've been in your shoes. I know what it's like to spend Sunday nights catching up on invoices instead of relaxing with family. That's why I only build automation that actually works in the real world."

            <h3 class="font-display text-xl text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">My Approach</h3>
            
            <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              No buzzwords. No death by PowerPoint. No systems that require a PhD to operate. I build automation that your least tech-savvy employee can use without calling you.
            </p>

            <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Every system I build has one goal: give you back time. Whether that's automating invoice reminders so you're not chasing money, or setting up lead responses so you never miss an opportunity at 9 PM on a Friday.
            </p>

            <div class="bg-navy-900 text-white p-6 rounded-lg my-8">
              <h4 class="font-display text-lg mb-3">Want to verify my experience?</h4>
              <p class="opacity-90 mb-3">
                Ask me about:
              </p>
              <ul class="space-y-2 opacity-90">
                <li>• The hot sauce FIFO system that saved $5,000/year</li>
                <li>• How we processed 50,000 orders/month with 6 people</li>
                <li>• Why I know exactly what keeps you up at night</li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
              I'm not here to impress you with technical knowledge. I'm here to help you stop doing robot work so you can focus on growing your business and enjoying your life.
