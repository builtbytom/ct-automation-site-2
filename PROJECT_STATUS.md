# Connecticut Business Automation - Project Status

## Current Status: Services Page 90% Complete
**Last Updated**: January 8, 2025

## What We've Accomplished Today

### 1. Problems Section ✅
- Started with janky bento grid that didn't work on mobile
- Rebuilt as simple 2-column responsive grid with solid navy background
- Made all 6 problem cards brutally relatable with real scenarios:
  - Invoice: Actual overdue invoice with "90 DAYS OVERDUE" stamp
  - Lead Response: Phone notification at 9:47pm with lost sale
  - Data Entry: "Robert Martinez" typed into 4 different systems
  - Scheduling: Email thread "RE: RE: RE: Quick meeting?"
  - Marketing: $4,510 spent with no attribution
  - Lost Documents: "smith_contract_FINAL_v2_USE_THIS.pdf" search chaos
- Fixed alignment issues and removed "Hell" → "Nightmare"

### 2. Services Section ("How We Work Together") ✅
- Clean 4-step process with transparent pricing:
  - Step 1: Quick Fit Call (FREE)
  - Step 2: Automation Roadmap ($500, credited)
  - Step 3: Build It Right ($2,500-$3,000)
  - Step 4: Keep It Running ($400/month, optional)
- Simple cards, no fancy animations, just clear information

### 3. Automation Examples Section ✅
- Three-tier categorization: Perfect/Possible/Not Worth Automating
- Mobile-friendly expandable cards (no text walls)
- Specific examples with time savings and ROI
- SEO-friendly with QuickBooks, Square/Stripe mentions
- Trust-building "Not Worth Automating" section

### 4. CTA Strategy Refined ✅
- Removed CTAs from Problems and Automation sections
- Now only in: Hero, Services (natural placement), and final CTA
- Less pushy, more educational

## What's Next
