# Connecticut Business Automation - Mobile-First Rebuild

## Status: COMPLETE âœ…
**Date**: July 6, 2025

## What Happened
The original site had severe mobile issues (horizontal scrolling, nav overlap, etc). We completely rebuilt it from scratch using a mobile-first approach.

## Current State
- **Location**: `/Users/thomaslucia/ct-automation-v2/`
- **Branch**: `mobile-first-rebuild` (ready to merge)
- **Tech**: Astro + Tailwind CSS v3 (not v4)

## Key Improvements
- Mobile-first build (no scrolling issues)
- Accessible flip cards with keyboard support
- Fixed all alignment issues
- Proper responsive navigation
- 60x stat positioned correctly (top-right)
- Timeline uses Tom's original copy
- CTA simplified (no redundant steps)
- Phone: (203) 679-1715
- Email: tom@ctautomation.com

## Deployment
To replace the current site on Netlify:
1. Merge `mobile-first-rebuild` to `main`
2. Site will auto-deploy

## Next Session
The homepage is complete. Ready for additional pages (Services, About, Contact, etc).
