  // Cost & ROI
  {
    id: 1,
    category: 'Cost & ROI',
    question: 'What does business automation actually cost?',
    answer: 'It depends on what you need automated. Simple workflows (like automatic invoice reminders) start around $150/month. More complex systems (like full QuickBooks automation with multiple touchpoints) run $500-1500/month. I always start with a free consultation to understand your needs and give you real numbers - no surprise pricing.',
    popular: true
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    category: 'Cost & ROI',
    question: 'How quickly will I see a return on my investment?',
    answer: 'Most clients break even within 2-3 months. If you\'re currently spending 10 hours a week on tasks we automate, and you value your time at even $50/hour, that\'s $2,000/month in time savings alone. Plus, automated systems don\'t miss follow-ups, which means more collected revenue.',
    popular: true
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    category: 'Cost & ROI',
    question: 'Can I afford NOT to automate?',
    answer: 'Let\'s flip this question: What\'s it costing you now? Late nights doing data entry, missed follow-ups with clients, errors from manual work, or simply not having time to grow your business. One client told me automation gave her her weekends back - what\'s that worth to you?',
    popular: false
  },
  {
    id: 4,
    category: 'Cost & ROI',
    question: 'Is there a contract or can I cancel anytime?',
    answer: 'No long-term contracts. We work month-to-month after the initial setup. If the automation isn\'t saving you time and money, you can cancel with 30 days notice. I\'m confident in the value, so I don\'t need to lock you in.',
    popular: false
  },
  {
    id: 5,
    category: 'Cost & ROI',
    question: 'Do you offer payment plans?',
    answer: 'Yes, for larger implementations, we can spread the setup cost over 3-6 months. The goal is to make automation accessible, not create financial stress.',
    popular: false
  },

  // I'm Not Tech-Savvy
  {
    id: 6,
    category: 'I\'m Not Tech-Savvy',
    question: 'I can barely handle email. Can I really use automation?',
    answer: 'Absolutely. The whole point is to make your life easier, not harder. Once set up, good automation runs itself. You won\'t need to touch code or learn complicated software. If you can send a text message, you can use what I build for you.',
    popular: true
  },
  {
    id: 7,
    category: 'I\'m Not Tech-Savvy',
    question: 'What if I break something?',
    answer: 'You won\'t. I design systems specifically for non-technical users. Everything has safeguards, clear instructions, and fail-safes. Plus, I\'m always a phone call away if you need help.',
    popular: false
  },
  {
    id: 8,
    category: 'I\'m Not Tech-Savvy',
    question: 'Will I need to learn new software?',
    answer: 'Minimal to none. Most automations work with software you already use (like QuickBooks or Gmail). When we do introduce something new, it\'s always simple and I provide full training.',
    popular: false
  },
  {
    id: 9,
    category: 'I\'m Not Tech-Savvy',
    question: 'How much time will I need to invest in learning this?',
    answer: 'Usually 1-2 hours total. I provide video walkthroughs, written guides, and live training. Most clients are comfortable within a week.',
    popular: false
  },

  // QuickBooks & Invoice
  {
    id: 10,
    category: 'QuickBooks & Invoice',
    question: 'Can you really automate my QuickBooks invoice follow-ups?',
    answer: 'Yes, completely. Imagine this: Invoice goes out → automatic friendly reminder at 7 days → firmer reminder at 14 days → final notice at 30 days → notification to you if still unpaid. All personalized, all automatic. One plumber client increased his on-time payments by 40% in two months.',
    popular: true
  },
  {
    id: 11,
    category: 'QuickBooks & Invoice',
    question: 'What if my clients get annoyed by automated reminders?',
    answer: 'They won\'t, because these aren\'t robotic spam emails. They\'re personalized, professionally written messages that sound like they came from you. Plus, most clients appreciate the reminders - they\'re busy too and often just forgot.',
    popular: false
  },
  {
    id: 12,
    category: 'QuickBooks & Invoice',
    question: 'Can automation handle partial payments or payment plans?',
    answer: 'Yes. The system can track partial payments, adjust reminders accordingly, and even manage payment plan schedules. It\'s smarter than just "paid or unpaid."',
    popular: false
  },
  {
    id: 13,
    category: 'QuickBooks & Invoice',
    question: 'Does it work with QuickBooks Desktop or just Online?',
    answer: 'I primarily work with QuickBooks Online because it has better automation capabilities. If you\'re on Desktop, I can help you transition or find workarounds.',
    popular: false
  },
  {
    id: 14,
    category: 'QuickBooks & Invoice',
    question: 'Can it send different types of invoices to different types of clients?',
    answer: 'Absolutely. Residential vs commercial, net-30 vs due-on-receipt, regular clients vs one-offs - the automation can handle different rules for different client types.',
    popular: false
  },

  // AI vs Traditional
  {
    id: 15,
    category: 'AI vs Traditional',
    question: 'Is this just ChatGPT in a fancy wrapper?',
    answer: 'No. While I use AI as one tool in my toolkit, real business automation is about connecting your existing systems, creating reliable workflows, and solving specific problems. AI might help write a customer email, but the automation that tracks invoices, schedules follow-ups, and updates your CRM? That\'s solid, proven technology.',
    popular: true
  },
  {
    id: 16,
    category: 'AI vs Traditional',
    question: 'How is this different from just hiring a virtual assistant?',
    answer: 'Automation works 24/7, never calls in sick, never makes typos, and costs less than a part-time VA. Plus, it scales instantly - handling 10 invoices or 1,000 takes the same effort. That said, automation handles repetitive tasks so you (or your VA) can focus on work that actually needs a human touch.',
    popular: false
  },
  {
    id: 17,
    category: 'AI vs Traditional',
    question: 'Will AI replace my job?',
    answer: 'No, it frees you to do your actual job. If you\'re a plumber, automation handles the invoicing so you can fix pipes. If you\'re a consultant, it manages scheduling so you can consult. It handles the boring stuff you hate anyway.',
    popular: false
  },
  {
    id: 18,
    category: 'AI vs Traditional',
    question: 'What happens when AI makes a mistake?',
    answer: 'Good automation has human checkpoints for critical decisions. AI might draft an email, but you approve it. It might flag an overdue invoice, but you decide how to handle a long-time client. I build in safeguards.',
    popular: false
  },

  // Getting Started
  {
    id: 19,
    category: 'Getting Started',
    question: 'How do I know if my business needs automation?',
    answer: 'If you\'ve ever thought "there has to be a better way" while doing the same task for the hundredth time, you need automation. If you\'re working evenings and weekends on admin tasks instead of growing your business, you need automation. If you\'ve ever lost a client because you dropped the ball on follow-up, you definitely need automation.',
    popular: false
  },
  {
    id: 20,
    category: 'Getting Started',
    question: 'What\'s the first step?',
    answer: 'We start with a free 30-minute consultation. No prep needed - just bring your biggest headaches and I\'ll show you what\'s possible. We\'ll identify your most painful repetitive tasks and I\'ll give you honest feedback on what can be automated.',
    popular: false
  },
  {
    id: 21,
    category: 'Getting Started',
    question: 'How long does implementation take?',
    answer: 'Simple automations can be up and running in a week. More complex systems take 2-4 weeks. I work with your schedule and can phase implementation so you see value immediately while we build the complete system.',
    popular: false
  },
  {
    id: 22,
    category: 'Getting Started',
    question: 'What information do you need from me?',
    answer: 'Initially, just a conversation about your pain points. For implementation, we\'ll need access to the relevant systems (with your permission), examples of your current processes, and maybe 2-3 hours of your time total for setup and training.',
    popular: false
  },
  {
    id: 23,
    category: 'Getting Started',
    question: 'Can we start small and expand later?',
    answer: 'That\'s actually my preferred approach. Start with one painful problem, automate it, see the results, then expand. Most clients start with invoice follow-ups and add more automations once they see how much time they save.',
    popular: false
  },

  // Industry-Specific
  {
    id: 24,
    category: 'Industry-Specific',
    question: 'I\'m in construction/trades. Will this work for my industry?',
    answer: 'Absolutely. I\'ve automated invoicing for plumbers, estimate follow-ups for electricians, and project updates for general contractors. Construction businesses often see the biggest wins because you\'re usually too busy on job sites to handle office work.',
    popular: false
  },
  {
    id: 25,
    category: 'Industry-Specific',
    question: 'Does this work for professional services (lawyers, accountants, consultants)?',
    answer: 'Yes. While every industry has unique needs, the core problems are similar: client communication, appointment scheduling, invoice tracking, and follow-ups. I\'ve helped consultants automate proposal follow-ups and lawyers automate client intake.',
    popular: false
  },
  {
    id: 26,
    category: 'Industry-Specific',
    question: 'What about retail or e-commerce?',
    answer: 'Definitely. Inventory alerts, customer follow-ups, review requests, abandoned cart reminders - retail has tons of automation opportunities. One boutique owner told me automation gave her time to actually talk to customers instead of doing data entry.',
    popular: false
  },
  {
    id: 27,
    category: 'Industry-Specific',
    question: 'Can you handle regulated industries like healthcare?',
    answer: 'Yes, with appropriate safeguards. I\'ve worked with dental offices and medical practices. We ensure all automations comply with HIPAA and other regulations. Some processes may need more human oversight, but there\'s still plenty we can automate safely.',
    popular: false
  },

  // Implementation & Support
  {
    id: 28,
    category: 'Implementation & Support',
    question: 'What if I need help after setup?',
    answer: 'I\'m not one of those "set it and forget it" consultants. Every client gets my cell number. Quick questions are free. For ongoing support or major changes, I offer maintenance packages. Most issues are solved with a 5-minute phone call.',
    popular: false
  },
  {
    id: 29,
    category: 'Implementation & Support',
    question: 'Who actually builds and maintains the automation?',
    answer: 'I do. This isn\'t outsourced to overseas developers or junior staff. You work directly with me from consultation through implementation and support. I\'m based in Connecticut and understand local business needs.',
    popular: false
  },
  {
    id: 30,
    category: 'Implementation & Support',
    question: 'What happens if you\'re not available?',
    answer: 'All automations are built on reliable platforms that won\'t break if I\'m on vacation. I document everything clearly so any competent tech person could maintain it if needed. But in 10 years, I\'ve never left a client hanging.',
    popular: false
  },
  {
    id: 31,
    category: 'Implementation & Support',
    question: 'How do you handle training my team?',
    answer: 'I provide video tutorials, written guides, and live training sessions. Everything is recorded so new employees can get up to speed. Most systems are so intuitive that training takes less than an hour.',
    popular: false
  },
  {
    id: 32,
    category: 'Implementation & Support',
    question: 'Can you integrate with my existing systems?',
    answer: 'Almost always. I\'ve integrated with dozens of CRMs, accounting systems, and industry-specific software. If your systems can talk to the internet, I can probably automate them.',
    popular: false
  },

  // Security & Compliance
  {
    id: 33,
    category: 'Security & Compliance',
    question: 'Is my data safe with automation?',
    answer: 'Yes. I use enterprise-grade security, encrypted connections, and follow best practices for data protection. Your data stays in your systems - the automation just connects them securely. I\'m also fully insured.',
    popular: false
  },
  {
    id: 34,
    category: 'Security & Compliance',
    question: 'What about client confidentiality?',
    answer: 'Automation actually improves confidentiality by reducing human touchpoints. Fewer people need access to sensitive data when systems handle routine tasks automatically. All automations can include audit trails for compliance.',
    popular: false
  },
  {
    id: 35,
    category: 'Security & Compliance',
    question: 'Do you sign NDAs?',
    answer: 'Of course. Your business information is confidential. I sign NDAs regularly and take client privacy seriously. What happens in your business stays in your business.',
    popular: false
  },
  {
    id: 36,
    category: 'Security & Compliance',
    question: 'Can automation help with compliance requirements?',
    answer: 'Yes! Automation is great for compliance because it creates consistent, documented processes. Need to track client communications for regulatory reasons? Automation can log everything automatically.',
    popular: false
  },

  // Integration
  {
    id: 37,
    category: 'Integration',
    question: 'Will this work with my existing software?',
    answer: 'In 95% of cases, yes. Popular platforms like QuickBooks, Gmail, Outlook, most CRMs, and even industry-specific tools usually have ways to connect. During our consultation, I\'ll verify compatibility with your specific stack.',
    popular: false
  },
  {
    id: 38,
    category: 'Integration',
    question: 'What if I change software later?',
    answer: 'Good automation is modular. If you switch from, say, QuickBooks to Xero, we update that connection point without rebuilding everything. I design with flexibility in mind because businesses evolve.',
    popular: false
  },
  {
    id: 39,
    category: 'Integration',
    question: 'Can you connect systems that don\'t normally talk to each other?',
    answer: 'Usually, yes. Even if two systems don\'t have direct integration, I can often build bridges using automation platforms. I\'ve connected some pretty unusual combinations - if data can get out of one system, I can probably get it into another.',
    popular: false
  },
  {
    id: 40,
    category: 'Integration',
    question: 'Do I need to buy new software?',
    answer: 'Rarely. I prefer working with what you already have and know. Sometimes I might recommend a tool to fill a specific gap, but only if it provides clear value. No expensive software packages required.',
    popular: false
  },

  // Results & Expectations
  {
    id: 41,
    category: 'Results & Expectations',
    question: 'What results do your clients typically see?',
    answer: 'The numbers speak for themselves: 10-15 hours saved per week, 40% improvement in on-time payments, 90% fewer missed follow-ups, and most importantly - business owners who actually enjoy running their business again instead of drowning in admin work.',
    popular: false
  },
  {
    id: 42,
    category: 'Results & Expectations',
    question: 'How do I measure if automation is working?',
    answer: 'We set clear metrics upfront: hours saved, payment speed, response times, error rates, etc. I provide monthly reports showing exactly what the automation is doing. You\'ll feel the difference in your daily stress levels too.',
    popular: false
  },
  {
    id: 43,
    category: 'Results & Expectations',
    question: 'What if it doesn\'t work for my business?',
    answer: 'In 10 years, I\'ve never had a business that couldn\'t benefit from some form of automation. But if we truly can\'t find value, I\'ll tell you upfront. I\'m not interested in selling you something you don\'t need.',
    popular: false
  },
  {
    id: 44,
    category: 'Results & Expectations',
    question: 'What\'s the biggest mistake businesses make with automation?',
    answer: 'Waiting too long to start. Every week you delay is another week of wasted time and missed opportunities. The second biggest mistake? Trying to automate everything at once instead of starting with one painful problem and expanding from there.',
    popular: false
