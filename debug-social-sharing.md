# Social Sharing Debug Checklist

## Issues Found and Fixed:

### 1. ✅ Removed Problematic SPA Redirect
**Problem**: The netlify.toml had a catch-all redirect sending everything to index.html
```toml
# OLD (REMOVED):
[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200
```

**Fix**: Replaced with proper 404 handling for static site
```toml
# NEW:
[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/404"
  status = 404
```

### 2. ✅ Fixed Misplaced Image
**Problem**: `ct-business-automation-results.webp` was in `/public/` instead of `/public/images/`
**Fix**: Moved file to correct location

### 3. ✅ Added Cache Headers
**Added**: Proper cache headers for images with special no-cache for social image

## Verification Steps:

1. **Clear Social Media Caches**:
   - Facebook: https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/
   - Twitter: https://cards-dev.twitter.com/validator
   - LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/post-inspector/
   
2. **Test URLs**:
   - Homepage: https://ctbusinessautomations.com
   - Article: https://ctbusinessautomations.com/resources/articles/ct-business-examples
   
3. **Check Image Direct Access**:
   - https://ctbusinessautomations.com/images/social-card-july-2025.webp
   
4. **Verify Meta Tags** (View Page Source):
   - Look for: `<meta property="og:image" content="https://ctbusinessautomations.com/images/social-card-july-2025.webp">`

## Deployment Steps:

1. Commit and push changes:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix social sharing image issues - remove SPA redirect, fix image paths"
git push
```

2. Wait for Netlify to deploy (usually 1-2 minutes)

3. Use the debugging tools above to refresh cached previews

## What Was Happening:

The "How Connecticut Businesses Win Back Time" image was likely showing because:
1. The SPA redirect was interfering with proper meta tag parsing
2. Social platforms were caching an old version
3. The misplaced image file might have caused a fallback to another image

The fixes above should resolve all these issues once deployed and caches are cleared.
