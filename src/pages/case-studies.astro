Chasing payments, scheduling estimates, following up on quotes, reminding customers about seasonal services. He was spending 15+ hours a week on stuff that wasn't landscaping.",
    quote: "I was working 60-hour weeks, but only 40 of those were actually making money. The rest was just... business stuff that made me want to quit.",

    solution: "Complete customer management system. When someone requests a quote, they automatically get Mike's portfolio and scheduling link. After the estimate, automatic follow-ups until they decide. Once they're a customer, the system handles invoicing, payment reminders, seasonal service suggestions, and renewal scheduling.\n\nEverything talks to everything else. No more double data entry, no more forgotten follow-ups.",
