    Sarah runs a hair salon in Hartford. Great location, loyal clients, one massive problem: 15-20% of her appointments were no-shows. At $75 per appointment, she was bleeding $3,000+ every month.
  </p>

  <div class="highlight-box">
    <h3>The Math That Made Her Sick</h3>
    <p>20 no-shows/week Ã— $75 average ticket Ã— 4 weeks = $6,000/month in lost revenue</p>
    <p>Plus the wasted product, idle stylists, and turning away walk-ins who could've filled those slots.</p>
  </div>

    The "This Can't Keep Happening" Moment
  </h2>

  <p>It was a Saturday. Sarah had blocked out 3 hours for a complex color correction - a $350 service. The client no-showed. No call, no text, nothing.</p>

  <p>Sarah tried calling. Straight to voicemail. Texted. No response.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, she'd turned away two other clients who wanted that time slot. That's when she called me, practically in tears: "Tom, I can't run a business like this."</p>

    Why People No-Show (It's Not What You Think)
  </h2>

  <p>Here's what I've learned setting up reminder systems for dozens of Connecticut businesses:</p>

  <ul class="space-y-3 mb-8">
    <li class="flex items-start gap-3">
      <span class="text-coral-500 text-xl">1.</span>
      <div>
        <strong>They simply forgot.</strong> Life gets busy. Your appointment from 3 weeks ago isn't top of mind.
      </div>
    </li>
    <li class="flex items-start gap-3">
      <span class="text-coral-500 text-xl">2.</span>
      <div>
        <strong>They think they told you.</strong> "I swear I called to cancel" - but they actually just thought about calling.
      </div>
    </li>
    <li class="flex items-start gap-3">
      <span class="text-coral-500 text-xl">3.</span>
      <div>
        <strong>They're embarrassed to cancel.</strong> So they ghost you instead.
      </div>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>The solution? Make it stupid easy to remember AND stupid easy to reschedule.</p>

    The Dead-Simple System That Fixed Everything

  <p>Here's exactly what we set up for Sarah's salon:</p>

    What This Actually Costs
  </h2>

  <p>Let's talk real numbers:</p>

  <ul class="space-y-3 mb-8">
    <li><strong>Setup:</strong> $1,500 one-time (includes integration with your booking system)</li>
    <li><strong>Monthly:</strong> $150-300 (depends on appointment volume)</li>
    <li><strong>Payback period:</strong> Usually 2-3 weeks</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Sarah recovered the entire setup cost in 10 days. Now she nets an extra $4,500/month after paying for the system.</p>

    Common Questions About Reminder Systems
  </h2>

  <div class="space-y-6">
    <div>
      <h3 class="font-semibold text-lg mb-2">Won't my clients find it annoying?</h3>
      <p>Opposite. Sarah's clients LOVE it. They thank her for the reminders. Nobody wants to no-show - they just need help remembering.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div>
      <h3 class="font-semibold text-lg mb-2">What if they don't have a smartphone?</h3>
      <p>The system works with regular texts too. Click the link or just reply "YES" or "RESCHEDULE". We also do voice call reminders for clients who prefer that.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div>
      <h3 class="font-semibold text-lg mb-2">Can it work with my booking system?</h3>
      <p>If you're using Square, Acuity, Calendly, or pretty much any modern booking system - yes. If you're using a paper book... we should talk about that too.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

    Who Else This Works For
  </h2>

  <p>I've set up similar systems for:</p>
  
  <ul class="space-y-2 mb-8">
    <li>â€¢ <strong>Dentists in Stamford</strong> - Reduced no-shows from 25% to 4%</li>
    <li>â€¢ <strong>Auto shop in New Haven</strong> - Saved 10 hours/week on phone tag</li>
    <li>â€¢ <strong>Personal trainer in Westport</strong> - Went from 5 no-shows/week to maybe 1</li>
    <li>â€¢ <strong>Home inspector in Norwalk</strong> - 90% reduction in wasted drive time</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="cta-box">
    <h3>Stop Losing Money to No-Shows</h3>
    <p>Every week you wait is another $750 down the drain. Let's fix this.</p>
    <p class="text-sm mb-4">Connecticut businesses only. Setup usually takes 24-48 hours.</p>
