      <h2>The Short Version</h2>
      <p>
        I'm Tom, and I run Connecticut Business Automation. I don't sell your data, I don't spam you, 
        and I only use your information to help automate your business. That's it.
      </p>

      <h2>What Information I Collect</h2>
      <h3>Information You Give Me</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Your name and email when you fill out forms</li>
        <li>Your business name and industry</li>
        <li>Phone number if you provide it</li>
        <li>Any details about your business processes you share during consultations</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Information Collected Automatically</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Basic analytics about which pages you visit (via Google Analytics)</li>
        <li>Your general location (city/state level)</li>
        <li>What device and browser you're using</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How I Use Your Information</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>To respond to your inquiries</li>
        <li>To send you automation tips and updates (only if you opted in)</li>
        <li>To improve my services and website</li>
        <li>To create custom automation solutions for your business</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Who I Share Your Information With</h2>
      <p>
        Nobody. Seriously. I don't sell, rent, or trade your information. The only exceptions are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Service providers I use to run my business (like email services)</li>
        <li>If required by law (hasn't happened yet)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Your Data in Automation Systems</h2>
      <p>
        When I build automations for you, your data stays in your own accounts (QuickBooks, Gmail, etc.). 
        I don't store copies of your business data. Any test data used during development is deleted after 
        your system goes live.
      </p>

      <h2>Cookies</h2>
      <p>
        This site uses basic cookies for analytics and to remember your preferences. No creepy tracking 
        across the internet.
      </p>

      <h2>Your Rights</h2>
      <p>You can:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Ask me what information I have about you</li>
        <li>Request that I delete your information</li>
        <li>Opt out of any emails</li>
        <li>Ask me to correct any wrong information</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Data Security</h2>
      <p>
        I use industry-standard security measures to protect your information. This includes secure 
        hosting, encrypted connections, and limited access to your data.
      </p>

      <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
      <p>
        If I make any significant changes, I'll update the date at the top and notify active clients.
      </p>

          <strong>Plain English Promise:</strong> I wrote this policy myself, not some lawyer. If anything 
          seems unclear or sketchy, please ask. Running an honest business means being transparent about 
          this stuff.
