**Last Updated**: January 8, 2025 - 11:30 AM EST

## What We've Accomplished Today

### 1. Problems Section ✅
- Started with janky bento grid that didn't work on mobile
- Rebuilt as simple 2-column responsive grid with solid navy background
- Made all 6 problem cards brutally relatable with real scenarios:
  - Invoice: Actual overdue invoice with "90 DAYS OVERDUE" stamp
  - Lead Response: Phone notification at 9:47pm with lost sale
  - Data Entry: "Robert Martinez" typed into 4 different systems
  - Scheduling: Email thread "RE: RE: RE: Quick meeting?"
  - Marketing: $4,510 spent with no attribution
  - Lost Documents: "smith_contract_FINAL_v2_USE_THIS.pdf" search chaos
- Fixed alignment issues and removed "Hell" → "Nightmare"

### 2. Services Section ("How We Work Together") ✅
- Clean 4-step process with transparent pricing:
  - Step 1: Quick Fit Call (FREE)
  - Step 2: Automation Roadmap ($500, credited)
  - Step 3: Build It Right ($2,500-$3,000)

## Current Challenges

### Netlify Platform Outage
- Started at 10:26 AM EST (confirmed on status page)
- "Issues running builds across Netlify" - platform-wide
- Both CT site and iBuild site affected
- Manual deploys also hanging in "New" state
- All code safely pushed to GitHub, will auto-deploy when fixed

### Local Development Issues
- localhost:4321 refusing to connect
- Can't preview Real World Examples section
- Not blocking progress, just annoying

## What's Next

### Immediate Priority: Comprehensive FAQ Section
Based on SEO research, we discovered what people are actually searching for:
1. **Cost concerns** - "How much does automation cost for small business"
2. **Tech fears** - "no-code automation", "I'm not tech-savvy"
3. **Invoice automation** - Huge search volume, specific QuickBooks mentions
4. **AI questions** - Differentiator opportunity, address hype vs reality
5. **Implementation fears** - Timeline, disruption, business size concerns

### FAQ Strategy:
- 30-40 questions organized by pain points
- Based on actual search data from Connecticut
- Not an accordion - searchable/filterable design
- Strategic CTAs on high-intent questions
- Build EEAT and trust throughout

### After FAQ:
1. AI & Automation educational page
2. Resources/blog section
3. Case studies/success stories
4. Industry-specific landing pages
5. SEO optimization (meta tags, schema, sitemap)

## Key Decisions Made
- Simple over fancy (no more broken bento grids)
- Mobile-first always (expandable cards, no text walls)
- Trust over selling (removed excessive CTAs)
- Real examples over abstract benefits

## Git/Deployment
- Using repo: ct-automation-site-2 (connected to Netlify)
- Old repo (ct-automation-site) removed from remotes
- Branch: mobile-first-rebuild → main
- Auto-deploys to Netlify on push
