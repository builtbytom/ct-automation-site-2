### 🚧 WHAT'S IN PROGRESS:

1. **Client Portal Credential Management**
   - Portal UI exists at /src/pages/portal/dashboard.astro
   - Need to add secure credential input
   - Decision made: Use SMTP for all email (universal)
   - Store credentials encrypted, pass to N8N

### 📋 NEXT PRIORITIES:

1. **Complete Portal Credential System**
   ```
   Priority: HIGH
   Components needed:
   - Credential input form in portal
   - SMTP auto-detection logic
   - Secure storage (pass-through to N8N)
   - Connection testing
   ```

2. **Connect Portal to Backend**
   ```
   - Portal currently shows mock data
   - Need API endpoints for:
     - Client authentication
     - Automation status
     - Metrics/ROI data
     - Credential management
   ```

3. **Deploy Portal**
   ```
   - Build portal for production
   - Deploy to Netlify
   - Configure portal.ctbusinessautomations.com
   - Test client flow
   ```

### 💡 KEY DECISIONS MADE:

1. **Credential Handling**
   - Use SMTP for all email operations (universal compatibility)
   - Portal collects credentials, passes to N8N (no storage)
   - Auto-detect SMTP settings for common providers
   - Client enters credentials once in friendly portal

2. **Architecture**
   - N8N handles all automation logic
   - Portal is the client-facing interface
   - Credentials stored only in N8N (encrypted)
   - Portal never stores sensitive data

3. **Security**
   - N8N public registration disabled
   - All traffic over HTTPS
   - Automated backups
   - Firewall configured

### 📁 KEY FILES CREATED/MODIFIED:

1. **Server Configuration**
   - /opt/ct-automations/docker-compose.yml
   - /opt/ct-automations/.env (passwords)
   - /opt/ct-automations/backup.sh
   - /etc/nginx/sites-available/n8n

2. **Local Project Files**
   - /workflows/lead-capture-automation.json
   - /workflows/lead-capture-no-twilio.json
   - /workflows/WORKFLOW_SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md
   - /src/pages/portal/dashboard.astro (existing)

### 🔐 CREDENTIALS & ACCESS:

### 🎯 SUCCESS METRICS:

- ✅ Platform accessible via HTTPS
- ✅ Can create and run workflows
- ✅ Automated backups working
- ✅ Professional domain setup
- ⏳ Portal deployment pending
- ⏳ First client onboarding pending

### 🚀 READY FOR CLIENTS?

**Almost!** Need to:
1. Deploy portal with credential management
2. Create onboarding documentation
3. Test full client flow
4. Create pricing/contract templates

### 📝 TOM'S HOMEWORK:

1. **Play with N8N** - Create test workflows
2. **Think about first client** - Who would be easiest?
3. **Pricing strategy** - Confirm $2,500 setup + $400/month

### 🆘 COMMON COMMANDS FOR REFERENCE:

```bash
# SSH to server
ssh root@159.89.84.35

# Check Docker containers
docker ps

# View N8N logs

## 🎊 CELEBRATION NOTES:

Tom went from "I don't know directories" to:
- Setting up a VPS
- Running Docker containers
- Configuring SSL certificates
- Managing a production server

This is HUGE! The platform is live and secure. Next session will be mostly clicking buttons in browsers, not terminal commands.
